Wenli Li obtained her Ph.D. in microbial genetics in 2003 at the Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. From 2004-2008, she carried out postdoctoral research in School of Pharmacy, University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA. After a research career in the PPD company in the States (2008-2009), she was appointed as a Full Professor in the School of Medicine and Pharmacy, Ocean University of China. Her current research focuses on the synthetic biology of secondary metabolites from marine microorganisms, and lead compounds discovery by genome mining and combinatorial strategies. She has published over 80 scientific papers on these and related topics.

Yuchao Gu was born in 1981. He received his B.S. degree from Ocean University of China (Qingdao China) in 2003 and his Ph.D degree from Ocean University of China in 2008. He was offered a lecturer position the same year in Ocean University of China. He was named professor and Ph.D supervisor in 2018. He focuses on the roles and mechanisms of O-GlcNAcylation in cancer formation and progression, and also tries to develop new methods for O-GlcNAcylation detection. Additionally, he is also interested in developing nanobody drugs from shark.

Fei Xiao received her B.S. degree in Pharmacy from Ocean University of China (Qingdao China) in 2013 and her Ph.D degree in Biochemistry with Prof. Wenli Li from Ocean University of China in 2019. She is currently doing her postdoctoral research in the laboratory of Prof. Wenli Li at Ocean University of China. She focuses on the natural products biosynthesis and engineering, and the study of biosynthetic enzyme mechanisms.

ChunniLiu joined the laboratory of Prof. Wenli Li at Ocean University of China as an undergraduate in 2020. She is currently a master's student in the Study on molecular mechanism of enzyme. She joined iDEC as a team leader and under took major experimental tasks. 

Yuechen Jiang was graduated from Ocean University of China, her major is pharmacy. And now She's studing at Ocean University of China master’s major is Microbiology and Biochemical Pharmacy. She has a wide range of interests, belcanto, swimming and traditional Chinese painting.

Fang Wang joined the Wenli Li’s Lab in 2020, She is studying for a master's degree in pharmacy, and her research interests include microbiology and synthetic biology. She is mainly responsible for updating the team wiki.

Shengmin Piao joined the Li Lab as an undergraduate in 2020, and since then, he has studied a variety of subjects, including molecular biology and natural product chemistry. He is currently a master's student in the Marine Fungi and Secondary metabolites Program. He can adapt to the new environment and accept new knowledge quickly. Beside he is hardworking and ready to endure hardships.

ChengyingYin joined the Laboratory of Glycobiology in Ocean University of China as an undergraduate in 2020, and since then has worked on a variety of projects, both experimental and computational. She is now an MSc student in the Bioinformatics and Marine microbial enzymology Master's Program, and her research interests include bioinformatics and recombinant gene expression. Chengying started the OUC-Marine Drugs iDEC team because she is excited about learning more technologies about new field.

Ziwei Wei joined the Laboratory of Glycobiology in Ocean University of China in 2020 and followed Professor Han on marine enzyme development. She joined the OUC-Marine Drugs iDEC team as a graduate student, hoping to contribute to the team's research with her knowledge of polysaccharide metabolism. At the same time, she is also very happy to have the opportunity to progress with team members.

Shiji Chu, from ocean University of China, majoring in pharmacy. For professional learning, he is good at organic chemistry, biochemistry and so on. In practice, he attachs great importance to the accumulation of experimental experience. He participated in the project "Screening of Multidrug-resistant Bacteria strains in Deep-sea Samples and Exploration of their active components", and accumulated experimental experience.
