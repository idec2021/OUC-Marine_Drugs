The Bacillus-derived glycosyltransferase (GT) BmmGT1 exhibited broad substrate flexibility, especially towards sugar acceptors, showing a great potential in natural products diversification. However, compared to the natural sugar acceptor macrolactin A (MLN A), the conversion rates of BmmGT1 towards other acceptors are much lower. Herein, the catalytic activities of BmmGT1 towards sugar acceptors was enhanced via directed evolution. A small library of variant BmmGT1 with mutated binding sites mutants were generated and screened using a 3-acetyl-7-hydroxycoumarin-based ultraviolet spectrophotometry screening method. Two mutants (M79F and M79W) were obtained, showing ~2.1-fold higher glucosylation activities towards 3-acetyl-7-hydroxycoumarin than the wild-type BmmGT1. Their catalytic activities towards other sugar acceptors were further tested, and the glucosylation activities of M79W was identified with ~3.6-fold and ~1.2-fold increase towards MLN A and piericidin A, respectively. Our study would provide guidance for engineering of other natural-product GTs via directed evolution.

Team UOregon is based out of the Plesa lab at the Univeristy of Oregon's Knight Campus for Accelerating Scientific Impact. Our group focuses on developing high-throughput technologies to characterize sequence space, and we are interested in leveraging directed evolution as a strategy to explore natural adaptation and engineer proteins.
